# Landing Page Redesign Checklist

## 1) Header / Navigation
- [ ] Increase logo and nav readability (size/contrast).
- [ ] Keep 3–5 top-level links max.
- [ ] Add one clear header CTA (`Start free` / `Get SWIFT`).
- [ ] Ensure sticky header does not overlap content.
- [ ] Add visible keyboard focus states.

## 2) Hero
- [ ] Replace typo CTA (`Get Get SWIFT`) with a single clear action.
- [ ] Use one strong H1 (benefit-first, not generic).
- [ ] Add short supporting subheading (1 sentence).
- [ ] Keep primary CTA + optional secondary CTA only.
- [ ] Add trust line under CTA (e.g., “No credit card required”).
- [ ] Increase vertical spacing so hero feels dominant.

## 3) Feature Summary (3 cards)
- [ ] Convert each card to: icon → short title → 1–2 line benefit.
- [ ] Remove long paragraphs; keep scan-friendly copy.
- [ ] Ensure contrast passes accessibility (text vs card background).
- [ ] Keep equal card heights and consistent padding.
- [ ] Add “Learn more” or section anchor if needed.

## 4) Pricing
- [ ] Add monthly/yearly toggle with clear active state.
- [ ] Mark one plan as **Recommended** visually.
- [ ] Align plan names, prices, and button positions.
- [ ] Standardize feature bullets (same style and depth).
- [ ] Make CTA labels specific (`Start Starter`, `Choose Pro`).
- [ ] Add short billing clarity text (taxes, trial, cancel anytime).

## 5) Social Proof / Testimonials
- [ ] Add real-looking attribution format (name, role, company).
- [ ] Use shorter quotes for fast scanning.
- [ ] Keep testimonial card styles distinct from pricing cards.
- [ ] Add star rating or outcome metric where possible.
- [ ] Limit to 3 strong testimonials above the fold continuation.

## 6) Footer
- [ ] Reduce link density; group into 3–4 clear columns.
- [ ] Increase legibility for small text.
- [ ] Keep newsletter input/button height and spacing consistent.
- [ ] Add legal links (Privacy, Terms, Cookies).
- [ ] Keep social icons aligned and visually balanced.

## 7) Visual System (global)
- [ ] Define spacing scale (e.g., 8px rhythm) and apply consistently.
- [ ] Reduce repeated gray blocks; create section contrast via background/elevation.
- [ ] Limit to one primary button style + one secondary style.
- [ ] Standardize border radius, shadow, and stroke weights.
- [ ] Set max content width and consistent container padding.

## 8) Accessibility
- [ ] Meet WCAG contrast for text and controls.
- [ ] Ensure heading hierarchy is semantic (H1 → H2 → H3).
- [ ] Add `aria-label`s for icon-only controls.
- [ ] Verify keyboard navigation and visible focus rings.
- [ ] Respect reduced motion preferences.

## 9) Mobile / Responsive
- [ ] Test at 320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px+.
- [ ] Collapse nav into accessible menu.
- [ ] Stack cards with adequate tap targets (44px min height).
- [ ] Prevent text overflow and cramped pricing columns.
- [ ] Keep CTA visible without excessive scrolling.

## 10) Conversion & Content
- [ ] Choose one primary conversion goal per page.
- [ ] Keep CTA copy action-oriented and consistent.
- [ ] Add objection-handling microcopy (setup time, billing, support).
- [ ] Include final CTA near footer (“Start free today”).
- [ ] Remove placeholder/demo disclaimers from primary conversion path.
